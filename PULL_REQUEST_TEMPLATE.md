_Y = Yes, N = No, P = Partial, N/A = Not Applicable_

**Win:** It took me a while to understand `Array.map`, but once I grasped the callback concept it was smooth as John Coltrane Jazz.

**Struggle:** Passing a function as an argument without execution of the function was complex to understand.

**Questions:** Do I have to put the parentheses while passing the function name in the parameters?

**Comments:** Loved the lesson, but I'm a little bit stuck with resolving promises... some extra material and exercises would help.
